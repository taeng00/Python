Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, 
And sorry I could not travel both And be one traveller, long I stood
And looked down one as far as I could to Where i t bent in the undergrouth
Then took the other, as just as fair, And having perhaps the better claim, Because it was grassy and wanted wear
Though as for that the passing there
Had worn them really about the same,
And both that morning eqully lay
In leaves no step had trodden black.
Oh, I kept the first for another day!
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
I doubted if I should ever come back.
